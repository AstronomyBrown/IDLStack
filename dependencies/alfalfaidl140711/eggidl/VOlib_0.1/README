PROJECT: VOlib
Current Version: Beta 0.1
Date Released: 02/23/05

Purpose: To provide IDL libraries for use with common
         Virtual Observatory (VO) tools and services.

General Comments: Many of these services require actual
                  webservices (i.e., SOAP or HTTP PUT
                  and GET). SOAP webservices are described
                  in there WSDLs (Web Service Description
                  Language) files at the source. These
                  WSDLs are downloaded and compiled in
                  JAVA. Thus, VOlib for IDL requires the
                  IDL Java Bridge (IDL version 6.+) and
                  its proper configuration.

                  The VO Table reader uses the native IDL
                  XML reader IDLffXMLDOM.

                  Some "services" are just HTTP PUT and
                  GETs. These are less elegant than true
                  webservices, and files must be downloaded
                  and then read in (unlike in SOAP-based web
                  services where data is streamed right into
                  an IDL structure). Thus, VOlib needs
                  write permissions in your working diectory.

Installation: unzip and untar the the file (gunzip VOlib_0.1.tar.gz,
              tar xvf VOlib_0.1.tar). Place the idljavabrc in your
              home directory as .idljavabrc (i.e., hidden). Place
              the following two lines in your .cshrc file:

             setenv IDLJAVAB_LIB_LOCATION /usr/java/java/jre/lib/i386/client/
             setenv IDLJAVAB_CONFIG /home/usename/.idljavabrc
             setenv IDL_PATH ${IDL_PATH}:+/home/chrism/idl/VOlib_0.1/pro
             setenv IDL_PATH ${IDL_PATH}:+/home/chrism/idl/VOlib_0.1/dependencies


              The first environment variable locates your JAVA lib
              libjvm.so. Make sure the libjvm.so file exists.
              The second locates your .idljavabrc. Edit this file
              for where you want the logs stored.
              The third and fourth tell IDL where to find the procedures.
              PRO contains the VO specific libraries, and DEPENDENCIES
              contains other IDL libraries you will need. This assumes
              that you *already* have IDL_PATH set, e.g. for the GSFC
              IDL ASTROLIB libraries:
              setenv IDL_PATH /home/user/idl/astron_lib/pro

              EDIT the file setupjava.csh to meet your local needs.
              Basically, find the location of your JAVA and place
              VOlib somewhere useful (e.g. /home/user/idl/VOlib).
              Then specify where VOlib lives. This setup script
              simply sets the environment variable CLASSPATH which
              is needed for all of the JAVA libraries.

Run: First, source your .cshrc.
     Second, source setupjava.csh
     Third, run IDL.

Failures: Can be due to any number of things: servers down, poorly
          formatted XML, buggy code, bad JAVA configuration, etc.
          You should look at a few things when your use of the code
          fails: 
          (1) Check if the server is actual up and running.
          (2) Try a call from your browser to the service (most
              of the procedures have a (commented out) print statement
              that will give you the precise call
          (3) If it is a JAVA bridge problem, look at the JB logs
              created by the JAVA bridge logging utility (see .idljavabrc).
          (4) If it is a JAVA bridge problem, run except.pro which catches
              the JAVA exception and prints some information.
          (5) Restart IDL.

Known Problems with IDL and JAVA: 
          These is a problem with the libstdc++ library on many 
          RedHat/Suse distros when working with IDL. You might need
          to rpm -force the following RPM:
