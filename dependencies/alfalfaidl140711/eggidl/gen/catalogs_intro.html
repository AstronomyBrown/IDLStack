<h2> An Introduction to Matching ALFALFA Detections to Optical Surveys</h2>

<a href="#2MASS">2MASS</a><p>
<a href="#SDSS">SDSS</a><p>
<a href="#VAGC">VAGC</a><p>

<p>
Being able to match ALFALFA detections to optical counterparts allows
for comparison to optical surveys and calculation of important
quantities such as M_B / L.
<p>
Information is provided here on how to do basic matches to two surveys
- 2MASS and SDSS.  Information is included on how to access these
surveys online.  In addition, routines are provided for matching to
the VAGC which contains recalculated (better?) SDSS magnitudes but is
only up to date for DR4.  The
matching procedures are simple at this time and return the nearest
optical counterpart.
<p>
A general useful procedure handles ALFALFA catalogs.
<UL>
<LI><a href="egggenlist.html#READ_ALFALFACAT">read_alfalfacat</a><p>
This procedure takes an output catalog from the ALFALFA pipeline and
reads it into an IDL structure with tag names matching the given
column headings.
</UL>


<p>
<h3><u><a name="2MASS">2MASS</a></u></h3><p>
<UL>
<LI><a
href="egggenlist.html#LIST_COORDS_2MASS">list_coords_2mass</a><p>
This procedure takes the pathname of an ALFALFA catalog and creates an
output textfile with a coordinate list formatted for input to GATOR.
The user can specify whether already identified optical counterpart
coordinates or HI detection coordinates should be used, with HI
coordinates being the default.  <p>
Note that the website specifies that filenames should be no more than
nine characters, alphanumeric or underscore, must start with an
alphabetical character and should have a '.tbl' extension. However,
files uploaded with no extension seem to work properly.  RA and DEC
are formatted to be in decimal degree format - this is the only format
currently allowed for the multi-object search.  The GATOR query
service for the Extended Source Catalog (XSC) can be found  <a href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/Gator/nph-scan?submit=Select&projshort=2MASS">here</a>.
<LI><a href="egggenlist.html#READ_2MASS">read_2mass</a><p>
This procedure reads the output from a 2MASS Gator query into an IDL
structure.  This procedure is independent of the number of columns and
returns column headings as tag names so
that the output from the Gator query can be modified.  However, the
formatting is only checked for the standard output so if any
non-standard columns are included that are not of the float format
(default) the procedure will need to be modified.
<P><b>Important!</b> The 'null' values in the 2MASS source list must
be replaced by ' -99' or a similarly valued (four character) place
holder for formatting reasons.
<LI><a href="egggenlist.html#MATCH2MASS">match2mass</a><p>
This procedure takes the pathnames for an ALFALFA catalog and 2MASS
source lists, reads the catalogs into structures, matches based on
coordinates, and returns a structure containing the information from
both catalogs.The 2MASS source list contains a column (dist_x)
containing the separation between the 2MASS source and input
coordinates in arcseconds. In addition, a column named detections is
added that details the number of matches found for a given set of input coordinates.
Currently the closest 2MASS object is returned by default.
<LI><a href="egggenlist.html#CORR_MAG_2MASS">corr_mag_2mass</a><p>
This procedure takes an ALFALFA catalog and 2MASS source list, matches them using match2mass and applies magnitude corrections.  
The IDL friendly version of the AGC is restored (note that this takes
time) and is used to find reddening values from the DIRBE maps which
are used to calculate Galactic extinction.
Which bandpasses and type of magnitude are to be corrected must be
specified. Otherwise the program defaults to returning no corrected magnitudes.  
The options are /jmag, /hmag and /kmag where at least one of the types of magnitude must be included - /iso or /ext.  
The procedure will check to make sure that the necessary magnitudes are included in the 2MASS file.
Internal extinction corrections are applied from Masters et al 2003.
The axial ratios from the K band are used for all three filters as this is part of the default output from 2MASS whereas axial ratios from H and J are not.
If the flag /noint is set, internal extinction corrections will not be applied.
This procedure outputs a structure that includes the matched catalogs and corrected magnitudes and their errors from measurement and uncertainty in the internal extinction correction. 
No effort is made to apply a k-correction at this point in time.

<h3><u><a name="SDSS">SDSS</a></u></h3><p>
<UL>
<LI><a href="egggenlist.html#LIST_COORDS_SDSS">list_coords_sdss</a><p>
This procedure takes the filename of an ALFALFA catalog and outputs a
text file that includes a list of ALFALFA source names and coordinates
in the format expected by SDSS.  This file can be uploaded <a
href="http://cas.sdss.org/dr6/en/tools/crossid/upload.asp">here</a> in
order to query DR6.  Note that the infile size is limited to 80 KB and
the output will not exceed 100,000 objects.  An example query can be
found <a href="egggenlist.html#LIST_COORDS_SDSS">here</a>.  Make sure
to select the CSV format for use with further IDL procedures.<p>
In addition, the coordinate list created by this procedure can be used
to find images at <a
href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/tools/chart/list.asp"> this
site</a> which returns mosaics of SDSS images centered at the
coordinates of interest.  The limit for this service is 1,000 objects
so large catalogs will need to be entered in pieces.
<LI><a href="egggenlist.html#READ_CSV_SDSS">read_csv_sdss</a><p>
This procedure reads a CSV output table from a SDSS SQL query into a
structure in IDL.  This is independent of the number of columns so
that the query output can be modified.  However if any output were to
be added to the example query given in <a
href="egggenlist.html#LIST_COORDS_SDSS">list_coords_sdss</a> that was
a string or integer, the procedure would need to be modified as the
default formatting is float.
<LI><a href="egggenlist.html#MATCH_SDSS">match_sdss</a><p>
This procedure takes an ALFALFA catalog and CSV file containing SDSS
sources found from a matched query using a coordinate list create by
list_coords_sdss and outputs a structure containing information from
both catalogs.  Two columns are added.  Detections list the number of SDSS sources within the search radius for each ALFALFA object.
The procedure defaults to returning the closest match.  The separation
between the ALFALFA coordinates and returned SDSS source is given in
the separation column.
<LI><a href="egggenlist.html#MAG_CORR_SDSS">mag_corr_sdss</a><p>
This procedure takes an ALFALFA catalog and SDSS source list and creates an output structure that includes B magnitude information (corrected and uncorrected for extinction).
This procedure will check that the necessary information is in the SDSS table and print warning if it is not there.
The B magnitude is calculated from Sloan g and r using the conversions in Blanton & Roweiss 2007.
This is an AB magnitude which is then transformed to Johnson B using the offset from Frei & Gunn, 1994.
The reddening values for Galactic extinction are found by matching to the AGC (IDL friendly version, restored).
Internal extinction corrections are applied based on Tully et al. 1998.
The axial ratio information comes from expab_g.  This is chosen on the basis that Sloan g is closest to B.
Also, most galaxies will be late type and well fit by an exponential profile.
Errors are propagated through from the g and r filters.  No errors are included for corrections at this point in time.
The user controls which magnitudes (if any) are returned.  The options are /model or /petro for model magnitudes (combination of deVacouler's and exponential fit) and Petrosian magnitudes.  
Note that the procedure expects model magnitude information by the tag name modelmag_? and not the short names ?, where ? represents the sloan filter.
If the flag /noint is set no internal extinction correction will be applied.
No effort is made to apply a k-correction at this point in time.

<h3><u><a name="VAGC">VAGC</a></u></h3><p>
These procedures require the SDSS Imaging portion of the VAGC
(preferably limited to sky coverage of ALFALFA).  This can currently
be found in '/home/humacao/humacao1/betsey/vagc/sdssimaging_alfalfa.sav'.<p>
<UL>
<LI><a href="egggenlist.html#MATCH_VAGC">match_vagc</a><p>
This procedure takes the full pathnames of an ALFALFA catalog and IDL
save file containing the VAGC limited to ALFALFA.  Note that the IDL
save file is presumed to be restored to sdssimaging_alfalfa.  At this
time no information is returned except from the SDSS imaging portion
of the VAGC.  The column 'match' gives an index for the ALFALFA
limited VAGC that can be used to query other catalogs at a later
date.  The indexing for ALFALFA is saved in
'/home/humacao/humacao1/betsey/vagc/index_alfalfa.sav'.  This
procedure searches within a box defined by radius for counterparts to
ALFALFA detections where one side of the box is defined by 2*radius.
If no radius is supplied, the default value is 60 arcsec.  The closest
counterpart is returned by default.  'Detections' tracks the number of
counterparts within the search area.  'Separation' gives the
separation between the ALFALFA coordinates and the closest optical
counterpart.  Note that this procedure is extremely slow.  This is
most likely do to the loop over which coordinate matches are found.
<LI><a href="egggenlist.html#CORR_MAG_VAGC">corr_mag_vagc</a><p>
This procedure calls match_vagc and computes B magnitudes and extinction corrections.
A structure is returned with ALFALFA, VAGC and B mag information.
Note that internal extinction correction is not applied due to missing axial ratio information from the SDSS imaging catalog of the VAGC.
In addition, there is currently no error propagation for the B magnitudes.
B magnitudes can be calculated from Petrosian or Model fluxes.  
The user may specify either or both, but if none are specified no B magnitude information will be returned.
The method for computing magnitudes is the same as for SDSS except that the VAGC provides Sloan fluxes which must first be converted to magnitudes.
<p>
</UL>

The procedures for the VAGC are currently the least sophisticated and slowest of the various catalogs.
