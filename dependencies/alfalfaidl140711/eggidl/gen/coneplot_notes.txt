CONE PLOT NOTES:
	Call is widget_cone_plot
	
	Widget window asks which catalog

	The command line requires input from the user:

		Type "y" or "n" for header info on catalog, default is n

		Type "c", "h" or "b" for locations of labels on cone plot, 
		default is c
			If you want labels every hour, be sure your catalog 
			starts and ends in even hour increments. For example,
			12.5-15.5 not 12.0-15.5.

		Type the dimensions of your final eps file output. A good size 
		is a sheet of paper, 8x10. The program will not move on until a
		value is typed.

		Restricting the plotted declination is allowed. If restriction
		is desired, new minimum and maximum declination should be typed
		in degree coordinates. For example: 00.0

		Restriction of the velocity range to be plotted is also allowed.
		Keep in mind that the plot range may need to be changed to
		match the true angle value. This can be done when the widget
		window pops up with the plotwidth text box.

	The program automatically calculates the RA center from the first and
	last entries of RA in the catalog. These are also the values used to
	calculate the hour labels. Make sure the first and last entries of your
	catalog are in fact the minimum and maximum RA.

	When the widget window pops up, the cone plot is plotted in the widget
	window with temporary placement of labels. When the plot is clicked,
	coordinate information is displayed at the bottom of the plot. The
	coordinate of each label can then be typed in the correct box to
	correctly place the labels. When the save button is pressed, an eps file
	is created in the current directory called: cone_plot.eps
