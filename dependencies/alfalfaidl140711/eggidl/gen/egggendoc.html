<H1>Documentation of EGGIDL Routines in /home/dorado3/galaxy/eggidl/gen</H1>

<p>This directory contains helpful IDL codes for EGG purposes, including basic procedures to calculate angular separations between objects, to 
convert galaxy types between different systems, and to convert heliocentric recessional velocities to velocities in the CMB rest frame. This 
directory also contains the ALFALFA distance calculation code.</p>
 
<p><h3>Links to Documentation Pages</h3></p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="egggenlist.html">egggenlist.html</a>: file created with the IDL routine mk_html_help, including the header information from every 
routine in the directory.
	<li><a href="/home/dorado3/galaxy/idl_alfa/README_DISTANCES.html">Estimating Galaxy Distances</a>: Tutorial for using idl_alfa procedures to 
calculate distances to objects 
in 
ALFALFA or AGC catalogs. Note that in January 2010, distance estimation software was moved from egggen/egggeninit to idl_alfa/alfinit.
	<li><a href="votables_intro.html">VOTables Introduction</a>: A tutorial for using the VOTables IDL library to retrieve FITS images from NVO 
SIAP Services, with examples and sample code for retrieving data from
SDSS.
        <li><a href="catalogs_intro.html">Catalog Matching
	Introduction</a>: An introduction for matching ALFALFA
	detections to other catalogs, including 2MASS, SDSS, and the VAGC. 

	<li>Plotting procedures (for ALFALFA paper-style diagrams in EPS format)
		<ul>
		<li><a href="egggenlist.html#EPSINIT">Epsinit</a> and <a href="egggenlist.html#EPSTERM">Epsterm</a>, which are routines that simplify the creation of EPS 
files. These are required for each of the following plotting procedures, and are compiled with EGGGENINIT.
		<li>Histograms, both <a href="egggenlist.html#CAT_HISTS_DISTANCE">with masses</a> (need to have a *.table formatted catalog output from distance_catalog.pro) 
and <a href="egggenlist.html#CAT_HISTS_GALCAT">without masses</a> (uses a GALCAT catalog). Histograms of cz, w50, integrated flux (logarithmic), and SNR (also logarithmic) in 
the GALCAT case, with an extra log(HIMASS) histogram in the case of CAT_HISTS_DISTANCE. For the papers, we use the 5-histogram version with masses, but CAT_HISTS_GALCAT 
exists so that you can take a quick look at your catalog 
after using GALCAT but before sorting out distance problems.
		<li><a href="egggenlist.html#CZDISTRIB">Expected redshift distributions</a> calculated for *.table formatted catalogs (output from distance_catalog.pro). 
Reads a catalog, and plots the observed redshift distribution as a histogram, with an overplot of a calculated expected redshift distribution. In the call to the program, you 
get to specify the Schechter parameters for your assumed 
HIMF.
		<li><a href="egggenlist.html#CONE_PLOT_OPT">Coneplots</a> are a little trickier; definitely read the documentation at the link to learn how to call the 
procedure. The code works whether your RA range crosses 0 hours or not. CONE_PLOT_OPT reads catalogs in GALCAT format, and then makes an EPS with two cone plots, one of 
ALFALFA galaxies in an RA, DEC range and one of optical galaxies (pulled out of the AGC) in the same range. Must specify an upper cz limit. The procedure automatically 
plots the outer edges of the cone (min and max RA) as well as a central line but in many cases you will want to add your own "rays" of RA and your own labels. Therefore, this 
is one 
case where it is probably wise to make a local copy to fuss with when you need to make your diagram look nice, but you can get the overall gist by using the EGGGEN version.
