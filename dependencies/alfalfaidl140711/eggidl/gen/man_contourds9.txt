Overlaying radio (or other) contours on images in DS9

1.  Create the contours in IDL. The last step of this process should be a 
	call to the CONTOUR procedure.

2a. Find the decimal degree coordinates of the edges of the image from 
	which the contours are being generated (e.g., for ALFALFA data you 
	can use the mousover features in gridview). Then define two 
	arrays:
		Let nx, ny be size of contour source image in pixels
		Let ramin, ramax, decmin, decmax be edge coordinates
		x = dindgen(nx)*( ramax- ramin)/(nx-1) +  ramin
		y = dindgen(ny)*(decmax-decmin)/(ny-1) + decmin
		[The "nx-1" assumes ramax is the value AT the edge pixel]
    Revise the call to CONTOUR so that the next two arguments after the 
    	image are x and y. The output should be exactly the same, but now 
    	with the graph axes in WCS rather than image coordinates.
2b. An alternative approach is to clip the source image to the size and 
	position of the image on which you plan to overlay the contours. 
	I consider this version more difficult and less flexible than 2a. 
	You may also have to fiddle with some settings to get DS9 to 
	recognize that your contours are in image coordinates; I haven't 
	checked.

3.  Call CONTOURDS9 with exactly the same arguments used in the call to 
	CONTOUR. Add a keyword argument, DS9REG, specifying the file to 
	which to print the contours.

4.  Start DS9, load the image on which you want to overlay the contours,
	and choose "Contour Parameters..." in the Analysis menu. In the 
	File menu of the countour parameters window, choose "Load 
	Contours..." and then select the file CONTOURDS9 created. The 
	contours should now be displayed on top of the loaded image.
