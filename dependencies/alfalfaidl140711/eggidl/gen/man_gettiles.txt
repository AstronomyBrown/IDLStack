Obtaining all GALEX survey tiles within a particular region

1. Run the following query (modified for whatever region and survey 
	you want) in MAST. Do not change the select clause. Save the 
	results in CSV format.

	select pe.tilenum, pe.tilename, pe.img, 
		pe.try, pe.subvis, pe.object
	from photoextract as pe
	where
	/* there really should be a rectangle retrieval function 
	   like for SDSS, but I can't find it */
	pe.crval1 between 176.0 and 210.0 and pe.crval2 between 12.0 and 16.0
	
	/* I'm sure the survey ID is stored in some table, but I 
	   can't find it */
	and (
	substring(pe.tilename, 1, 2) = 'NG'		// Nearby Galaxies Survey
	/*
	or substring(pe.tilename, 1, 3) = 'AIS'
	or substring(pe.tilename, 1, 3) = 'MIS'
	*/
	)
	
	and t.target_id = pe.tilename
	and pe.ow = 1

2. Run the MAKETILESCRIPT procedure in IDL with the name of the CSV 
	file as the first argument and the name of a new FTP script 
	file as the second.

3. Use the script to retrieve the tiles. The current version merely 
	grabs all intbgsub files; if you want other files, modify the 
	filetypes array in the procedure source. The script currently 
	does not support any QA files, such as the SExtractor regions.
