Overlaying sources on images in DS9

1. First make sure you have DS9 4.0 or later. Earlier versions 
	(including 3.0.3, the current astrosun install) do not have 
	catalog support.

2. Load the image on which to overlay.

3a. Execute an SDSS (or other database) query and store it in CSV format. 
	The fields must include "objID" (which may not necessarily be the 
	long SDSS ID -- just some kind of unique value) "ra", and "dec"
3b. Run 

4. In DS9, choose "Catalog Tool..." from the Analysis menu. From the 
	window's File menu, choose "Load Other..." followed by "CSV". 
	Select the file containing the query results.

5. In the catalog window, choose "Advanced..." in the Symbol menu. Choose 
	"Load..." from the new window's File menu, then choose sdss.sym. 
	This will change the format to small circles labeled by the value 
	of the "objID" column.
