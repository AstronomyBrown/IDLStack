Images and spectra from each Sloan data release are available on the web, and since SDSS follows the Virtual Observatory protocols, it should 
be simple to access and download such information using a set of tools in IDL's VOlib library.

This tutorial covers the basics of retrieving images, using SDSS DR4's SIAP (Simple Image Access Protocol). Many 
projects participating in the 
VO provide SIAPs, and SDSS provides other methods of getting at their data, but the SIAP is the simplest way to get at the FITS files. The 
tutorial will introduce the SIAP/VOTable concept, demonstrate how to download VOTables in XML format by hand (in a browser) or in IDL code, and 
will show how to use the VOTable XML format to locate and download FITS images from Sloan DR4. Sample code for obtaining g-band Sloan images at 
a list of coordinates is included. <p>

<UL>
<LI>Note that the SIAP will attempt to retrieve <b>all</b> the images that meet your search criteria. This means that you will get all of the 
images from a given survey/project that include the point you specified as your "center." Depending on how that particular project mapped that 
particular part of the sky, you might get several sets of overlapping images of varying sizes.
<LI>This may not be particularly useful for certain ALFALFA applications, such as searching for the SDSS FITS images of a particular ALFALFA 
object.
</UL>

<p>
<h3><u><a name="introduction">Introduction to SIAP</a></u></h3><p>
There are two ways to retrieve images from the SDSS DR4 SIAP service. 
<OL>
<LI>Use the SIAP webpage to create an XML table. This can then be read into IDL using a VOlib utility called "readvot," so that you can 
download gzipped FITS images.
<LI>Use the VOlib utility "siapcall," which will call the SDSS SIAP for you and download/unzip the images.
</OL>

The advantage of (2) is that it's faster and requires less interaction/coding on your part; the advantage of (1) is that it's more 
customizable, and you can do a lot without having to make any changes to the VOlib codes. Once you get acquainted with the VOtables, and write 
some short bits of code to make your own easier, (1) can become just as easy.

<p>

To get started, you need to identify the URL of the SIAP you want to use. You can do this by searching <a 
href="http://nvo.stsci.edu/voregistry/index.aspx">the Virtual Observatory Data and Service locator</a>. Enter a search term; in this case, 
"SDSS DR4" will get us what we need. The first result is the for DR4 SIAP; click the <a 
href="http://nvo.stsci.edu/voregistry/UpdateRegistry.aspx?SearchIdentifier=ivo%3a%2f%2fsdss.jhu%2fservices%2fSIAPDR4-images&ro=t">link</a>. 
This page lists a bunch of useful VO information about the SDSS DR4 SIAP, including a description. What's useful for us is the ServiceURL, 
listed in the middle of the page.
<p>

<u><h3><a name="using">Using the SIAP to download VOTables in XML Format</a></h3></u><p>

The SIAP URL is the key to using the SIAP service. It's what you use to download XML files or the input you use for siapcall.pro. In this case, 
the URL is <p>
<b>http://casjobs.sdss.org/vo/DR4SIAP/SIAP.asmx/getSiapInfo?&FORMAT=image/fits&BANDPASS=ugriz&
</b>
<p>

This URL accepts the usual "cone search" parameters to create a VOTable-formatted XML file. If you want, you can use this URL to manually 
download the XML VOTable (or you can have the Linux command wget do it for you, which we'll try in a bit). To get the XML file, you need to add 
a position (RA, Dec in J2000 decimal degrees) and a search radius (in decimal degrees) into the URL as "POS" and "SIZE" keywords. The "FORMAT" 
keyword is already in the SIAP URL, letting the service know that you're interested in FITS images. POS and SIZE are added in a similar way. 
For a position RA=180.0, Dec=0.12, and a search radius of 0.1, enter the URL:<p>
<b><a 
href="http://casjobs.sdss.org/vo/DR4SIAP/SIAP.asmx/getSiapInfo?POS=180.0,.12,&SIZE=0.1&FORMAT=image/fits&BANDPASS=ugriz&">http://casjobs.sdss.org/vo/DR4SIAP/SIAP.asmx/getSiapInfo?POS=180.0,.12,&SIZE=0.1&FORMAT=image/fits&BANDPASS=ugriz&</a>
</b>
<p>

Click the above link to see the XML output provided by this URL. It contains a header, and then a list of the available images meeting your 
search criteria. This information tells you (or IDL) where the images are located, both in "Sloan DR4 Space" and on the web. Let's save this 
XML file so we can play with it; call it "file1.xml." <p>
<UL>
<LI>Note that in the URL given above, and given in the VO registry, the "bandpass" keyword is already included, but this can be edited. If you 
only want, for instance, g-band images, you can delete the u, r, i, and z in the "bandpass" keyword. This altered URL will work whether you 
call it by hand or give it to a VOlib utility as an input. </UL>
<p>

There is another way to get the same XML file; this time, we'll call it "file2.xml." This time, we'll use the command "wget" to download 
the file directly, without having to use a browser. By invoking the IDL command "spawn," we can do this within any other piece of code we 
like. Start up an IDL session:

<pre> IDL> spawn, 'wget -q -O file2.xml "http://casjobs.sdss.org/vo/DR4SIAP/SIAP.asmx/getSiapInfo?POS=180.0,.12,&SIZE=0.1&FORMAT=image/fits&BANDPASS=ugriz&"'  </pre>

In the above call, file2.xml is the name we want to give to the downloaded XML file. The command wget needs to be completely enclosed in single 
quotes, and the URL is enclosed in double quotes. Again, we could specify g-band images by deleting the u, r, i, and z from the bandpass 
options. <b>file2.xml should be identical to file1.xml</b>.

<p>
If you want to write a piece of code that will download the XML file for you for several different right ascension and declination pairs, you 
need to make sure to convert RA and dec to strings, but you also need to use strcompress to remove <i>all</i> whitespace so it won't screw up 
the URL. The simplest code to do this would be:
<p>

<pre>
   PRO GETIMAGES,radegs,decdegs

   spawn, 'wget -q -O file_1.xml "http://casjobs.sdss.org/vo/DR4SIAP/SIAP.asmx/getSiapInfo?POS='+strcompress(radegs, /remove_all)+','+strcompress(decdegs,/remove_all)+'&SIZE=0.1&FORMAT=image/fits&BANDPASS=ugriz&"'
  
   end
</pre>

It might also be useful to be able to use the coordinates in the filename:

<pre>

    PRO GETIMAGES,radegs,decdegs
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
    filename=strcompress(radegs,/remove_all)
    print,filename
 
    ;in order to insert the string 'filename' into a command called using
    ;single quotes, use the '+ as below:                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
    spawn, 'wget -q -O '+filename+'.xml "http://casjobs.sdss.org/vo/DR4SIAP/SIAP.asmx/getSiapInfo?POS='+strcompress(radegs, /remove_all)+','+strcompress(decdegs,/remove_all)+'&SIZE=0.1&FORMAT=image/fits&BANDPASS=ugriz&"'
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
    end

</pre>

<p>
Since we need to use single quotes inside of single quotes, we use <b>'+</b> and <b>+'</b>. 
<p>
In the example at the end, we will look at some code that loops over many RA/dec pairs and that gives a different directory name to the images 
downloaded from each coordinate.

<p>

Once you have these XML files downloaded, you can use some utilities in the IDL VO library to download the FITS images. But before we get to 
that, let's look at a streamlined (but not easily customizable) way to get straight to your images:

<h3><u><a name="siapcall">Accessing FITS Images Using siapcall</a></u></h3><p>


Instead of downloading XML files in this way, you can also use a bit of code that comes with the VO IDL library, called siapcall. You can 
look at its documentation <a href="http://www.ctio.noao.edu/~chrism/VOlib/VOlib_help.html#SIAPCALL">here</a> (or see the list of <a 
href="#links">links</a> below).
<UL>
<LI>This code basically does what we just learned to do: it calls the SIAP service for a location on the sky. But then it goes further and 
downloads the images for you. This is very useful, but if you need to customize it -- say, you want to be able to change the filenames, or you 
want to run it over a serious of different locations -- you'll need to write some specialized code to do that and you might have to make your 
own "proprietary version" of SIAPCALL. Additionally, SIAPCALL requires some interaction from the user, making it more difficult to use in 
looping over many coordinate pairs. 
<LI>SIAPCALL is called by first defining the URL of the SIAP service, i.e. <pre>    
IDL>url='http://casjobs.sdss.org/vo/DR4SIAP/SIAP.asmx/getSiapInfo?&FORMAT=image/fits&BANDPASS=ugriz&' </pre> You also need to provide an output 
structure as well as the input parameters RA, dec, and search radius in degrees, like:
<pre>    IDL>siapcall, str=str, url=url, 180.0,0.12,0.1 </pre>
You will get some funny errors about converting strings to doubles, but this is apparently normal. You will also be prompted to delete some 
files as you go through (but if you want to save the XML file, use the /SAVE keyword), including some image files.
<LI> For the example given, you should have downloaded 10 images, numbered 0 through 9. This includes 2 different portions of the sky imaged in 
5 different bands. If you're unfamiliar with the FITS file format, BK 
found <a href="http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_samples.html"> a neat site with sample FITS files that can be 'viewed' through a Java applet</a>.
 </UL>

So now that you've seen what the VOTables library can do, how can you get at the information in all those XML files I had you download?

<p>

<h3><u><a name="xml">Accessing FITS Images from XML-Format VOTables</a></u></h3>
<p>
Using the utility "readvot" (see the <a href="http://www.ctio.noao.edu/~chrism/VOlib/VOlib_help.html#READVOT">documentation</a>), you can read 
your XML file into an IDL structure. You call it as <pre>    IDL>readvot,'file1.xml',str</pre> where "str" will be the name of the output 
structure. <pre>    IDL>print,n_elements(str)</pre> shows you that you have 10 elements, corresponding to the 10 images found for this region 
using "siapcall."
<pre>    IDL>help,str,/str</pre> shows you the various elements of the structure, including the RA, Dec, and (helpfully) the URL where Sloan is 
storing these images. <pre>    IDL>print,str.URL</pre> will display

</pre>

These can then be retrieved very easily using the wget commend on every element of the array:
<pre>
    ;----------------
    pro dlImages, str


    for i=0,n_elements(str)-1 do begin

    spawn, 'wget -q -O file'+strcompress(i, /remove_all)+'.fits.gz "'+str[i].url[0]+'"'

    endfor

    end
    ;-------------------------------------

</pre>

You can then use gunzip on all of the FITS files in order to view them.

<p>

<h3><u><a name="example">Example: Use a list of AGC numbers & coordinates to retrieve g-band images from Sloan DR4</a></u></h3>
<p>
Let's apply this to a specific task: using a list of coordinates to retrieve images. Since we're looking at many different places in the sky, 
it will be helpful to sort the images into different directories, using something like their RA to name them. We also want to gunzip the images 
in the final step.
<p>
Here are the coordinates we'll use:

<pre>
    258046 1500192+005700 15.005333 0.9500000
    253623 1501009+010050 15.016917 1.0138889
    254077 1501159+014625 15.021083 1.7736111
    253632 1502330+015608 15.042500 1.9355556
    253620 1500526+012418 15.014611 1.4050000
    253624 1501153+012954 15.020917 1.4983333
    252565 1506420+003804 15.111667 0.6344444
    252560 1509149+015517 15.154139 1.9213889
    253656 1512082+013509 15.202278 1.5858333 

</pre>
Put these coordinates into a file called coords.dat.
<p>
I have written some code (see example.pro, below) which will access coords.dat and, for each location, create a directory. The 
name of the directory is the RA in degrees, but this could easily be changed to the AGC (or NGC, VCC, etc.) number or the full coordinate 
string. The code then downloads the XML file, uses readvot to download the images into the correct directory, and finally gunzips the files.
<p><hr>
<pre>
PRO example

readcol,'coords.dat',agcnum,coordstring,rahr,decdeg,format='L,A,F,F'

radeg=rahr*15.0

;print,radeg
;print,decdegs

numpos=n_elements(radeg)
xstr='.xml'

;for each line in the file:
for i=0, numpos-1 do begin
	radegs=radeg[i]
	decdegs=decdeg[i]
	;create a 'filename' that will be used as the directory name for each line of coords.dat
	;the filename of the xml file will be radegs.xml
	filename=strcompress(radegs,/remove_all)
	print,'Filename: ',filename
	;make the directory
	spawn,'mkdir '+filename+''
	filexml=filename+xstr
	print,'File: ',filexml
	;download & name the XML file
	spawn, 'wget -q -O '+filename+'.xml "http://casjobs.sdss.org/vo/DR4SIAP/SIAP.asmx/getSiapInfo?POS='+strcompress(radegs,/remove_all)+','+strcompress(decdegs,/remove_all)+'&SIZE=0.1&FORMAT=image/fits&BANDPASS=g&"'
	;use readvot to read the XML file
	readvot,filexml,str
	;for each file found in the search, download the fits files
	for j=0,n_elements(str)-1 do begin
		spawn,'wget -q -O '+filename+'/file'+strcompress(j, /remove_all)+'.fits.gz "'+str[j].url[0]+'"'
	endfor
	;gunzip the fits files
	spawn,'gunzip '+filename+'/*.gz'
endfor

end
</pre>
<hr>
<p>
Note that the URL of the SIAP service is "hard-wired" in and couldn't be a user-provided input without setting the code up to split the URL 
string in the right place. But this could be done!
