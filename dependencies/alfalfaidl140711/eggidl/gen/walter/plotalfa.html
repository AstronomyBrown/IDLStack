 NAME:
       ALFABEAMS
 PURPOSE:
       Returns an array with the alfa beam coordinates
 EXPLANATION:
       Arrays are created that outline the alfa beams and their
       tracks depending on whether the beams are pointed towards the 
       north or south.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       ALFABEAMS, NBEAM, CENTRA, CENTDEC, DECTRACK, X, Y, XCENT_LABEL, YCENT_LABEL

 INPUTS:
       NBEAM - Which beam to plot  
       CENTRA - The center R.A.
       CENTDEC - The center Dec.


 OUTPUTS:
       X - The array with the x positions of the beam (this is to
           plot the beam circle)
       Y - The array with the y positions of the beam (this is to
           plot the beam circle)
       XCENT_LABEL - X coordinate of the center of the circle where the label should be
                     printed
       YCENT_LABEL - Y coordinate of the center of the circle where
                     the label (number) of the beam should be printed
       DECTRACK - Y coordinates of the dec of the track (which is at
                  the center of the beam)

 NAME:
       DRAWGAL
 PURPOSE:
       Returns an array with the galaxy coordinates that outline the
       galaxy

 EXPLANATION:
       Takes the galaxy radius, eccentricity and posang and creates 
       arrays that hold the galaxy drawing coordinates. 

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       DRAWGAL, XIN, YIN, GRAD, GEPS, GPA, SCALE, XGAL, YGAL, NGALPTS

 INPUTS:
       XIN - The x coordinate of the galaxy center  
       YIN - The y coordinate of the galaxy center
       GRAD - The radius of the galaxy
       GEPS - The galaxy eccentricity
       SCALE - Scaling factor (to enlarge the plot)

 OUTPUTS:
       XGAL - The array with the x positions of the galaxies (this is to
           plot the galaxy)
       YGAL - The array with the y positions of the galaxy (this is to
           plot the galaxy)
       NGALPTS - Number of points used to draw the galaxy

 NAME:
       GETBOUNDS
 PURPOSE:
       Calculates the plot bounds with the user defined range

 EXPLANATION:
       Takes the center R.A., center Dec and range given by the user
       and calculates the minimum and maximum R.A. and Dec

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       GETBOUNDS, CENTRA, CENTDEC, RAMIN, RAMAX, DECMIN, DECMAX, NPIX

 INPUTS:
       CENTRA - Center R.A. defined by user
       CENTRDEC - Center Dec defined by user
       NPIX - Range defined by user 

 OUTPUTS:
       RAMIN - Minimum R.A. in range
       RAMAX - Maximum R.A. in range
       DECMIN - Minimum Dec in range
       DECMAX - Maximum Dec in range

 NAME:
       PLOTALFA
 PURPOSE:
       Set up the gui.

 EXPLANATION:
       Set up the gui and let the event handler do the rest of the
       work (plotting).
       Plotalfa displays a widget where the user can input 
       coordinates and the size of the box that the user wants to 
       view. Plotalfa will plot all galaxies in the region along 
       with the alfabeam set up in this region.

 NAME:
       PLOTFRAME
 PURPOSE:
       Does the actual plotting of the beams, galaxies and frame of
       interest.
 EXPLANATION:
       Takes the user defined range and coordinates and plots
       all the galaxies in this range. Also shows the position of the
       alfabeams in this range.

<A HREF="#ROUTINELIST">[List of Routines]</A>
<PRE>
 NAME:
       PRINTAGCINFO
 PURPOSE:
       Output a string with agc info if cursor was on an agc galaxy 
 EXPLANATION:
       It reads in the file containing the info on the agc galaxies
       in the specified range and then checks if the cursor is within
       a certain range of the coordinates of the galaxy

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       PRINTAGCINFO, XCURS, YCURS, FOUNDFLAG, OUTPUTSTR

 INPUTS:
       XCURS - X position of the cursor 
       YCURS - Y position of the cursor

       FOUNDFLAG - If there are no agc galaxies in the position
                        this is set to 0, else 1.

                      galaxy
