	Tips on separating tight pairs with gridview/galflux

0) Most effective job uses gridview and galflux in parallel, not
galflux alone; gridview gives you the spatial information: use it!

1) Zoom in on region of interest on gridview and monitor closely the
channel numbers at which one member of the pair "starts" and "ends".

2) Select a galflux box that, for each member of the pair, tries to
contain as much of the flux of the meant  member, without including
much of the companion. Yeah, easier said than done. However, don't
worry if the box turns out to be very lopsided and it does not appear
to contain *all* the flux of the target; galflux is smart enough to
estimate the total flux from having as little as half in the flux box.

3) On galflux, set the feature's edge flags over the spectral range
including only channels *not overlapping* with the spectral range of
the companion, if possible. See how your choice of flags changes the
centroid of the HI with respect to that of the opt counterpart.

4) Keep an eye on the opt z, if available and of good quality (small error).

5) Measure your best guess, make sure that the parameter errors reflect
your uncertainty. Go to companion and repeat. 

It is generally a good idea to do the brighter member of the pair first.
Whenever there appears to be opt source crowding or apparent asymmetry
in the shape of the HI emission, see if that can be explained with a
blended pair and then try to separate it. Document your attempt in the
"comments" to the .src file.
