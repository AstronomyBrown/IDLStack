Grouping catalogs have been revamped slightly.  We now have two
separate group catalogs: Chris Marinoni's VDM catalog of the AGC
north, and "grp_assign.gals"-type file which includes group
assignments for SCI/SC2 groups and NOG groups.  It is the latter
catalog that is discussed here.

Everything remains pretty much as described by Riccardo in the section
below.  However, note that we also have a slew of galaxies from the
AGC that were added to existing NOG groups via the "supernog" process
which is explained in detail in the file "supernog_doc.txt", and is
also explained in Chapter 3 of my thesis (Springob 2005).  Such
galaxies have the parameter "algthm" listed as "CS".

Also, we've started attaching dates to the files in order to keep
track of which one is most recent.  grp_assign040810.gals is the list
of group assignments as of August 10th, 2004.  grp_assign060123.gals
is the version as of January 23rd, 2006, which includes all of the
modifications that Karen and I made when creating SFI++.  We looked at
each SFI++ template cluster, and changed some of the group
assignments, so those changes are all represented in
grp_assign060123.gals.  Any galaxy for which we changed the group
assignment has algthm='CK'.  Each of the grp_assign******.gals files
is also now in J2000 format, while the "common.groups" and
"nog3.groups" files are in B1950 format.

I - As of today, there are listings of 2 catalogs of groups:
	- a "common.groups" catalog, which includes objects in G97 and
	  Dale et al. plus A347, A426 and A539. That's 86 groups, with 
	  parms as chosen by us
	  Format:
	  ngrp, grpra,sign,grpdec,vhel,vcmb,verr,name
	  (i6,2i2.2,i3.3,a1,3i2.2,2i6,      i4,a)

 	Numbering system for common groups is
	- if group is Abell cluster, the nr is that of Abell catalog
	- if it is not Abell, then the number is
		1hhnn
	  where hh is the RA of the center in hrs, and nn is a progressive nr
	  This will allow future additions in the AGC mode.
	  NOTE: I have changed the parms of the group ESO 508 to match
	  the specs in NOG3. They look better than those in G97. All the
	  other groups are as in G97/Dale et al.

	- a nog3 catalog, as produced by MH from the Giuricin et al
	  (2000, ApJ 543, 178) paper, table 7. This catalog was
	  produced with cz_lg. MH converted it to cz_hel via

	  vlg = vh -79*cos(gl)*cos(gb) +296.*sin(gl)*cos(gb)-36.*sin(gb)

	  and rg converted this cz_h to cz_cmb using Vhel_to_cmb.f
          FORMAT:
	  ngrp,ngrp,grpra,sign,grpdec,vhel,vcmb,ngals,name+grp notes
	  (2i6,2i2.2,i3,3,a1,3i2,2i6,i4,a)
	  Note that the group nr (ngrp) is >30000
	  That's because we add 30000 to the group nr (3 is the id for nog3)
	  

II - Galaxies are assigned to either of those two group catalogs, in the
	file grp_assign.gals
 	Only group/cluster members are listed here (in+ type gals are not)
	This table has been built from one created by MH in
		/home/esperanza3/galaxy/groups/grp_assign.gals
	plus additions of all gals in the old 
	/home/tanama/riccardo/sc/make/cluster_assign
	which were not found in grp_assign.gals (gals in A347,A426,A539,
	A1367,A1656,A2151/47,A2197/99 and A2634. [the file cluster_assign
	was used as a cluster member file throughout the 90's]
	For each galaxy, the coords of the galaxy, the group nr, the group cntr 
	coords, the gal coords, the projected separation from the grp center in 
	arcmin (clusep) and the grp vcmb are listed, for use by make programs.
	FORMAT:
	nagc,ngrp,grpra,grpdec,galra,galdec,sep,ivcmb,algthm,name
	(i6, i6,            4f10.5,        f6.1,i6,1x,a2,a28)
	where all parms are self-explanatory, except algthm (the algorithm
	used in the group catalog construction for nog objects).

	For groups that are in more than one catalog, priority is given
	in the sense: 1. common.groups, 2. nog.
	Say common.group 10101 is nog3.group 30053.
	All galaxies either previously assigned to 10101 and those in
	30053 are assigned to 10101 [i.e. in grp_assign.gals there should
	be no trace left of reference to group 30053]

III - Comparison of NOG3 groups and our previous "common group" settings

I find a match between 22 NOG3 groups and our Common groups file.
Parameters in general agree, except in a few notable cases. The table
below has a comparison of the parms of those groups; first those in our
Common groups file, then those in the nog3. Differences in <cz> larger
than 100 km/s are found for the N383 and N507 groups, Cancer A, Cen30,
A3574, Pegasus and A569. Most of those systems are in high density
regions, where the group identification is difficult. The resulting
Vpec are changed in all cases by less than one sigma. I think we
should stick to our group def for the common groups, for consistency
with our previous work, except for ESO508 for which as already said
the nog3 parameters have been adopted

IV - How files were built.............

a) Started from MH's common.groups, nog3.groups and grp_assign.gals

b) Modified common.groups adding entries, vhel to vcmb and modifying format
   Modified nog3.groups, adding vcmb and modifying format

c) Modified grp_assign.gals to new.gals, which resets the group nrs
   according to new convention as described above, and adding manually
   galaxies in cluster_assign which did not make earlier version of 
	grp_assign.gals

d) Ran addra1.f on new.gals and common.groups, to include cluster coords
   and group vcmb for gals in common.groups.
		new.gals ==> step2.gals

d) Ran addra2.f on step2.gals and nog3.groups, to include cluster coords
   and group vcmb for gals in nog3.groups.
		step2.gals ==> step3.gals

e) Ran matchagc.f on step3.gals  ===> step4.gals = grp_assign.gals
   and agc files to obtain galaxy coords and sepmin, the separation in
   arcmin from the cluster/group center.
